        <h1>Load up the planet.json file</h1>
            <p>Be sure to use the promise, but for now just console.log the data returned inside of the then.</p>

        <H1>It might help to have a seperate function each of the remaining questions</h1>

        <h1>Create an empty table for the elements</h1>
            <p>For now just a table with the data bound to the rows (tr). It will not display anything, but check the elements tab to be sure that it created them.  I have an example, empty table below.</p>

        <h1>Create a table with one column, name.  </h1>
            <p>Start by creating the rows and binding the data to each row.  In a seperate step, select all of the rows and then append the next column.  No need to rebind the data, it was already bound to the rows.</p>

        <h1>Create a table with one column for each of the attributes in the planet data.  </h1>

        </div>
        
        <h1>Something Extra?</h1>
        <p>You've got a lot of leeway here.  Adding CSS to stlye this page wouldget you a 9, but to get a 10 you will need to come up with something to demonstrate deeper understanding of d3.</p>
